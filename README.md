A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is based on representational state transfer (REST), an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development. 

REST technology is generally preferred over the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage.
